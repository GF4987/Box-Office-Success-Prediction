# Box-Office-Success-Prediction

This is a 3-Stage Project in order to create a model that can predict box office revenue for a film.

Data for this project was sourced from BoxOffice Mojo (might change)

The first stage is to understand the data using a linear-regression model.
The second stage is to better the model by using random-forest or adverserial encoder.
The third stage is to create a UI in which a user can prompt a movie's details to get the prediction for the box office of that film.
